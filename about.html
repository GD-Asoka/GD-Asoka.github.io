  <h1> Greetings </h1>
  <br/>I am Abhi, A game designer and developer. I love playing games and making them. 
  <br/>Apart from games, I love riding my motorcycle, working out, and appreciating art.
  <br/>I have a bachelors degree in architecture, and a diploma in advanced game development.
  <br/>I love puzzle games, especially with good level design. My education and experience in game dev let me truly appreciate good design in games.
  <br/>I try to play a wide variety of games ranging in both quality and genre, to expose myself to the ingenuity of my fellow game devs. 
  <br/>My dream job would be working as a game designer on a game contributing in puzzle, narrative and level design.
  <br/>I also play competitive games like CounterStrike and Hearthstone. I am passionate about working on designing systems and features, and balancing mechanics for these games. 
  <br/>Thank you for checking out my humble little website. I hope you have a great day :)
