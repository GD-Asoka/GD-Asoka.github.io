  <h1> Greetings </h1>
  <br/>I am Abhi, A game designer and developer. I love playing video games and board games,  and also making them. 
  <br/>Apart from games, I love riding my motorcycle, working out, and being artistically creative - I like cooking, reading, making pixel art and low poly 3D models.
  <br/>I have a bachelors degree in architecture, and a diploma in advanced game development. My education and experience in game dev let me truly appreciate good design in games and other media.
  <br/>My favorite genre is puzzle games, especially with good level design - such as Portal 1 and 2. A close second would be choices matter games, especially with good NPC designs - such as Skyrim and Life is Strange.

  <br/>I play a wide variety of games ranging in both quality and genre, to expose myself to the ingenuity of my fellow game devs. 
  <br/>My dream job would be working as a game designer contributing in puzzle, narrative and level design.
  <br/>I also play a ton of competitive games from Counterstrike to Hearthstone. I am extremely passionate about working on a competitve multiplayer game, designing systems & features and balancing the game's mechanics.
  <br/>Even singleplayer games can be competitive, especially if you speedrun or nuzlocke them. My favorite game of all time is Sekiro. Possibly the greatest singleplayer experience ever crafted. The AI design in Sekiro is *chef's kiss* absolute perfection. 
  <br/>Thank you for checking out my humble little website. I hope you have a great day :)
