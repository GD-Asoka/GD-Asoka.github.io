The idea for this game was inspired during my phase of playing a ton of mind bending puzzle games like Fez, Topdee and Toodee, and a bunch of puzzle games on itch.io. 
<br/>I've always wanted to make a puzzle game with a (somewhat) unique mechanic. So I decided to make the Chronicles of Sticky Pete. 
<br/>The main mechanic of the game is switching between sidescroller Pete to topdown Pete and vice versa. When Pete goes into topdown Pete mode, the game essentially becomes a topdown game, where gravity works on the z axis (the line connecting you and the monitor (if you are sitting down and playing of course)).
<br/>And when Pete switches to sidescroller Pete, gravity is back to 'normal', working in the direction of real life gravity. Gravity only affects dynamic objects like enemies and boxes, and not static objects like walls and stuff. 
<br/>Early on in playtesting, the biggest issue with level design was that turning into top down pete essentialy made traversing the level trivial. There were many ideas to balance this
