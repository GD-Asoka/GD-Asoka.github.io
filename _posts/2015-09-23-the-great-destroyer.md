The concept for the game is you play as a game designer called Pete, who is dreaming. The only way to wake up is to solve the puzzles in his dreams. The main mechanic of the game is the ability of Pete to doodle jump from sidescrolling to top down perspective. 
<br/>He turned into the Great Destroyer.
