The Chronicles of Sticky Pete is my favorite game I've ever made. The concept of the game is switching perspectives using your 'doodle jump' ability. The art style is set in the sketch book of Pete, the game designer. The story is that Pete is dreaming, and you must help solve the puzzles in his dream to help him wake up.

The game was inspired by TooDee and TopDee, but in this game, there is only one character, and gravity changes every time sticky pete switches from topdown to sidescroller and vice versa. 
The biggest challenge initially was that the game became somewhat trivial if you were to play in top down mode the whole time. To solve this, I added highlight walls that can only be passed through when sticky pete is in a specific perspective, i.e either topdown or sidescroller. I also added a star system, where to get a perfect level, i.e 3 stars, you must complete the level optimally using the minimum number of doodle jumps necessary.

Finally, to make the levels hit the sweet spot of feeling challenging, I added easter eggs, which require a bit of thought to obtain. You must use all the knowledge you've gained throughout each level to solve this haiku.
