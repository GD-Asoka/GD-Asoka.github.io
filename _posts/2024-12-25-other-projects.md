<h2>Game Design Document</h2>
<br>I have created multiple Game Design Documents, but the one I made for my final project - Biodread is the most detailed. Created in Notion, it is essentially a Game Design Wiki that can be used by the entire team to ensure that every aspect of the game (almost) is clearly outlined and detailed.
