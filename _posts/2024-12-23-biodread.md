Biodread was the final project for my Advanced Game Development course. I worked on a team of around 15 people, including writers, artists, musicians, programmers and designers. It was a 3 month long project, and I started working as a game and level designer, but the scope of the game required me to learn FMOD and become the audio designer as well.

The gameplay takes inspiration from Lethal Company and Alien Isolation. The plot is that you are a faceless employee of Abyssal Salvage Co. You have been sent deep into the Mariana trench to clear any evidence of illegal experimentation left behind in their facilities. You must send evidence back to the company who will then pay you money, which you can use to buy O2 tanks, flashlights, and ultimately, your ticket to freedom.

The levels are split into 3 parts: the submarine, the facility, and the ocean. The submarine is your safe haven, where you can buy and sell items, and your O2 does not drain here.

When you step out into the ocean, your O2 starts draining, and the visibility is very low, so you need to use your flashlights and glowsticks to navigate.

Everytime you enter the facility, the layout is different as it is procedurally generated. The loot is also randomized.

Your goal in the facility is to avoid the mutated angler fish roaming the abandoned hallways, fit as much loot as you can in your inventory and safely return to the ship before your O2 drains out.
