<h2>The Lost Warrior</h2>
<br>One of my earlier projects in school. I was obsessed with figuring out how to make a 4D game, but with time limitations I decided to make a 2.5D game instead. This is essentially a platformer with split screen - 2 different orthographic views on each camera. Slightly mind bending :)

<br>a local multiplayer pong game with a twist. Each player has 3 lives, and you lose a life if your opponent scores against you. If you lose a round, you can choose between two power ups to give you an advantage the next round. First player to deplete the other player's health to 0 wins!

<h2>Nippon Ping Pong</h2>
<br>a VFX assignment I turned into a game. A simple relaxing game about balancing a ball for as long as you can. It gets harder the longer you play. Also playable on mobile.
