The lost warrior - One of my earlier projects in school. I was obsessed with figuring out how to make a 4D game, but with time limitations I decided to make a 2.5D game instead. This is essentially a platformer with split screen - 2 different orthographic views on each camera. Slightly mind bending :)

Mad Mod Kumar - I loved the art style of The Stanley Problem so much I wanted to make another game with the artist. So we collaborated for the GMTK (GameMaker's ToolKit) Game Jam 2023.

Nippon Ping Pong - a VFX assignment I turned into a game. A simple relaxing game about balancing a ball for as long as you can. It gets harder the longer you play. Also playable on mobile.
