Stonk Warrior - where it all started. A game where you play as a stock trader, made in 1 week with the constraint of only have one button for input.

The lost warrior's path - One of my earlier projects in school. I was obsessed with figuring out how to make a 4D game, but with time limitations I decided to make a 2.5D game. This is your run of the mill platformer, but it has split screen, with 2 different orthographic views on each camera. Slightly mind bending :)

The Stanley Problem - one of my first game jam entries. A short game inspired by the stanley parable and the trolley problem.

Mad Mod Kumar - I loved the art style of The Stanley Problem so much I wanted to make another game with the artist. So we collaborated for the GMTK Game Jam 2023.

Power Pong - a local multiplayer pong game with a twist. Each player has 3 lives, and you lose a life if your opponent scores against you. If you lose a round, you can choose between two power ups to give you an advantage the next round. First player to deplete the other player's health to 0 wins!

Nippon Ping Pong - a VFX assignment I turned into a game. A simple relaxing game about balancing a ball for as long as you can. It gets harder the longer you play. Also playable on mobile.
